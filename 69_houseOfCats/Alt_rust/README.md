[Back -> ](../README.md)

There are some people and cats in a house. You are given the number of legs they have all together. Your task is to return an array containing every possible number of people that could be in the house _sorted in ascending order_. It's guaranteed that each person has <code>2</code> legs and each cat has <code>4</code> legs.

**Example**

- For <code>legs = 6</code>, the output should be
<code>houseOfCats(legs) = [1, 3]</code>.

  There could be either <code>1</code> cat and <code>1</code> person <code>(4 + 2 = 6)</code> or <code>3</code> people <code>(2 * 3 = 6)</code>.

- For <code>legs = 2</code>, the output should be
<code>houseOfCats(legs) = [1]</code>.

  There can be only <code>1</code> person.

**Input/Output**

- **[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)**

- **[input] integer legs**

  The total number of legs in the house. It's guaranteed,that this number is even.<br>

  _Guaranteed constraints:_<br>
  <code>0 â‰¤ legs < 50</code>.

- **[output] array.integer**
  - Every possible number of people that can be in the house.
